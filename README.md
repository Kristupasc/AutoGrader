# Automated Grading Tool for Python Programming Exams

This repository contains the source code for a proof-of-concept automated grading tool developed as part of a thesis project at the University of Twente. The tool was created for the 41st Twente Student Conference on IT (TScIT41).

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to explore the feasibility of automating the grading of Python programming exams for first-year students in the bachelor programs at the University of Twente. The tool aims to lighten the load for teachers while maintaining high grading accuracy. The analysis of this concept can be found in the thesis paper.

## Grading Methodology

- **Static Code Analysis**: Evaluates the code based on checks on nodes in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
- **Dynamic Code Analysis**: Executes the code and checks for correctness of outputs.


## Limitations
* This tool is a proof-of-concept and is intended solely for academic purposes within the University of Twente.
* The tool requires manual writing for the tests and the grading criteria.
* Manual verification of the grading results is recommended to ensure accuracy.

Special thanks to **Leon de Vries** and **dr. W. Corbo Ugulino**  at the University of Twente for their guidance and support.

**Note:** This tool should not be used outside of the University of Twente without proper adaptation and validation for the intended use case.
